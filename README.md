# Neural Network

This repo implements a multi-layer neural network with momentum-based
gradient descent. The implementation uses an OOP approach instead
of the typical matrix-based approach. Although OOP is certainly much
slower, I chose this method mostly to improve my intuitive understanding
of neural network.

The example used to test this implementation was an XOR mapping which
resulted in an output error of less than 0.01
